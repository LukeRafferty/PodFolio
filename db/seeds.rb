# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)



# require 'audiosearch'
# # create a client
# client = Audiosearch::Client.new(
#   :id     => "#{ENV['AS_ID']}",
#   :secret => "#{ENV['AS_SECRET']}",
#   :host   => 'https://www.audiosear.ch/',
